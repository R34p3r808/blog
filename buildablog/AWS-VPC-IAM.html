            <h2>Creating a VPC with IAM roles for ec2 instances hosting a K8 cluster</h2>
<p class="paragraph">Join me as I create the necessary VPC and roles for ec2 instances running a K8 cluster.</p>
        <br/><br/>
                                        <center>Creating a new VPC</center>

        <p>For all intents and purposes, let's start a new virtual private cloud (VPC) network.  This will allow us to start a new subnet without
             interfering with other VPCs that may be set up.  You can keep it on your default VPC if you would like but this will show you how to 
             start it from the ground up.  It will also show the correct permissions (IAM roles) that will be assigned to the ec2 instances that will be hosting
             the Kubernetes cluster.  These permissions will allow the instances to interact with other AWS services such as load balancers, etc.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <h3>Create a new VPC with a new CIDR:</h3>
        <center><image class="vpc-create": imgage src="../Image/AWS_VPC/vpc-create.PNG"></center>
        <p>After the VPC is created, ensure that you add the tag: <italic>kubernetes.io/cluster/kubernetes.</italic> This will
        allow the K8 cluster to discover any resources with this tag name and recognize it.</p>
        <br/>
        <h3>VPC tag:</h3>
        <center><image class="vpc-tag": image src="../Image/AWS_VPC/vpc-tag.PNG"></center>
        <br/>
        <p>After you create the new tag for the VPC, you'll want to ensure that DNS hostnames is enabled on the VPC. You can do this as shown 
        in the following picture:
        </p>
        <center><image class="vpc-hostname": image src="../Image/AWS_VPC/vpc-hostname.PNG"><image class="vpc-hostname1": image src="../Image/AWS_VPC/vpc-hostname1.PNG"></image></center>
        <br/><br/>
                                    
                                        <center>Creating a new subnet in the VPC</center>
        <br/>
        <center><image class="vpc-subnet": image src="../Image/AWS_VPC/vpc-subnet.PNG"></center>
        <p>Ensure that you are adding the same tags to each newly created tool/service.  As you can see above, I added the <italic>
            kubernetes.io/cluster/kubernetes</italic> and make sure that the value is set to <bold>owned</bold>.</p>

        <center><image class="vpc-auto": image src="../Image/AWS_VPC/vpc-autoip.PNG"></center><center><image class="vpc-auto1": image src="../Image/AWS_VPC/vpc-autoipcheck.PNG"></center>

        <p>Right click on the new subnet that you just created and click on "Edit subnet settings". Once the next page loads you should see a section 
            named "Auto-assign IP settings".  Verify that the "Enable auto-assign public IPv4 address" is checked on. You may be asking if this is 
            the most secure method...unfortunately, it is not.  We will dial up the security in another blog to see what is accessible or not. Just
            keep in mind that this subnet will allow any new NIC assignment of a public IPv4 address (our ec2 instances). Since you own the website, you are able to pen-test it. Keep in mind
            that you CANNOT pentest AWS itself.  For more information on AWS pentesting: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/security/penetration-testing/" target="blank">https://aws.amazon.com/security/penetration-testing/</a>.
        </p>
        <br/>

                                    <center>Creating an Internet Gateway (IGW)</center>
        <p>We will create an IGW that will allow traffic to pass from the internet to our newly created subnet (keep the same tags as the
            other services):</p>
        <center><image class="vpc-igw": image src="../Image/AWS_VPC/vpc-igw.PNG"></center>
        
        <p>You will then want to attach the IGW to the VPC that you created:</p>
        <center><image class="vpc-igw-attach": image src="../Image/AWS_VPC/vpc-igw-attach.PNG"></center>
        <p>My "Attach to VPC" button is grayed out because I had already attached it prior to this. On the next page you should see a drop down
            menu that allows you to select your VPC.
        </p>
        <br/>

                                <center>Create a Routing Table</center>
        <p>Next step is to make a routing table for our VPC (again, don't forget the tag!):</p>
        <center><image class="vpc-rtbcreate": image src="../Image/AWS_VPC/vpc-rtbcreate.PNG"></center>
        <p>Associate the routing table with the K8 subnet:</p>
        <center><image class="vpc-rtbassociate": image src="../Image/AWS_VPC/vpc-rtbassociate.PNG"></center>
        <p>Select the subnet you would like to associate with (our new K8 subnet):</p>    
        <center><image class="vpc-subnetassociations": image src="../Image/AWS_VPC/vpc-subnetassociations.PNG"></center>
        <br/><br/>

                                <center>Time for some IAM Policies!</center>
       
        <p>In order for Kubernetes to interact with the necessary AWS services, we have to create IAM roles for two different ec2 instances.
            The two instances will be the master node and the worker nodes.
        </p>
       <p>For the IAM Master role we will creating a new policy first.</p>
       <center><image class="vpc-masterpolicy": image src="../Image/AWS_VPC/vpc-masterpolicy.PNG"></center>
       <p>As you can see, there is another policy named <italic>k8s-cluster-iam-worker-policy</italic>.  You will follow these exact same steps
        to create a worker node policy with a different JSON set.  For now let's create the <italic>k8s-cluster-iam-master-policy</italic>.
        Create that master policy and use the following JSON (formatting on this page isn't exact but AWS will take it):</p>

            <br/>
        }
        </div>
       <p>Feel free to look at each policy to see what it is doing.  It is essentially giving the Master ec2 instance the proper permissions to
           control ec2 services as well as load balancer services.  You will see why when we run our cluster.  It should initiate a load balancer
           automatically when you apply the proper service yaml file.
       </p>
       <p>Once you create the policy, AWS will fix the JSON formatting and it will look something like this:</p>
       <center><image class="vpc-masterpolicyjson": image src="../Image/AWS_VPC/vpc-masterpolicyjson.PNG"></center>
       <p>You will see that 6 sevices are set to allow:</p>
       <center><image class="vpc-k8masterpolicy": image src="../Image/AWS_VPC/vpc-k8masterpolicy.PNG"></center>
       <p>You can now create the policy.</p> 
        <br/>
                                            <center>IAM Roles</center>
        <p>Now that we have created a policy, we want to create a role that can be attached to the policy. Verify that you have selected
            the EC2 use case as seen in the picture below.
        </p>
        <center><image class="vpc-roleec2": image src="../Image/AWS_VPC/vpc-roleec2.PNG"></center>
        <p>After you click 'Next', you will see a list of policies.  Select the one that pertains to this new role (Master policy):</p>
        <center><image class="vpc-selectpolicy": image src="../Image/AWS_VPC/vpc-selectpolicy.PNG"></center>
        <p>On the following page after selecting your policy, you can name your role whatever you would like.  Just ensure to make it
            recognizable for future selection upon initializing an ec2 instance. Make sure that you click on 'Create Role':</p>
        <center><image class="vpc-rolefinal": image src="../Image/AWS_VPC/vpc-rolefinal.PNG"></center>
        <br/>
        <p>After you have created your Master policy and role, you will complete the exact same steps to create a Worker policy and role. 
            Here is the JSON necessary to make a Worker policy (thankfully, the JSON is much smaller):

                                    <center>Let's spin up our EC2s!</center>
            <p>Now that we have created the networking and the roles/policies necessary to get Kubernetes up and running, we can make our ec2
                instances. Keep in mind that my AWS page layout may be a bit different.  I am using the new rollout that AWS is testing but
                the underlying information is the same.
            </p>
            <h3>Master EC2 Image:</h3>
            <center><image class="masterec2": image src="../Image/AWS_VPC/masterec2.PNG"></center>
            <p>Verify that you have selected the Ubuntu 18.04 OS. I have verified that this is the best practice when using the newest
                versions of Kubernetes (v1.24) and Docker with containerd (CRI).
            <h3>Adding the tag:</h3>
            <center><image class="tagsec2": image src="../Image/AWS_VPC/tagsec2.PNG"></center>
            </p>
            <h3>Instance type and Key pair:</h3>
            <center><image class="instancetype-keypp": image src="../Image/AWS_VPC/instancetype-keypp.PNG"></center>
            <p>For the purposes of using Kubernetes, you need to use at least 2 vCPUs and 2 GB of memory/RAM. If you dont't, Kubernetes will
                not work correctly. I am using a t3.small instance type since it is a bit cheaper and I will only be creating 3 images of my static
                site on kubernetes.  If you have a larger site or application that requires a lot of processing and memory, you may want to 
                use a larger instance.  A step up from the one that I am using would be the t2.medium (2 vCPU and 4 GB of memory/RAM).  At the time
                of this blog, t2.medium is double the price, but we are talking about pennies.</p>
            <p>You may can use an existing key pair or create a new one to SSH into the instances.  I recommend using key pairs over username and
                password which can be a lot less secure.</p>
            <h3>Network settings:</h3>
            <center><image class="networksettings": image src="../Image/AWS_VPC/networksettings.PNG"></center>
            <p>For the first instance you'll want to select 'Create security group'. Click on the 'Edit' button on the top right of the 
                Network Settings box and you will see the option to create your own rules.  Copy the same one that I am using, 'All Traffic' 
                (Again, we will check security on this in another blog, focus is to get Kubernetes up and running
                for now). You can see this in the image below.  <bold>When you create the worker node EC2 instance, you will click 'Select existing security group'
                </bold> and put it in the same SG as the Master node.
            </p>
            <center><image class="createsg": image src="../Image/AWS_VPC/createsg.PNG"></center>
            <h3>Adding the EC2 instance to the Master role:</h3>
            <center><image class="ec2role": image src="../Image/AWS_VPC/ec2role.PNG"></center>
            <p>Scroll to the bottom and click on the carrot next to the 'Advanced details' section and you will see the drop down where you can
                select the appropriate master role.  You will now rinse and repeat the EC2 steps for the worker node.  The only difference is that 
                you will select to add the instance to the already existing SG from your Master EC2 instance and to select the worker role instead of
                the master role.
            </p>
                                    <center>That wraps up part 2!</center>
            <p>Stick around to follow me in the next blog where I set up kubernetes and get the whole website running.  We're almost there.  
            Get excited! We will be seeing our website/app up and showing publicly shortly.
