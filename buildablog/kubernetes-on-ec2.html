            <h2>Configuring Kubernetes on AWS EC2: Hosting our Website</h2>
<p class="paragraph">Want to see how to make a website and put it in a Docker container?</p>
        <br/><br/>
                                        <center>Installing Ubuntu 18.04 and Initializing for Docker</center>

         <p>For the intention of ensuring that my website is working within a docker container I will be using docker on an Ubuntu virtual 
            machine instead of an ec2 instance on AWS. It's easier to spin it up locally first rather than trying to debug any errors on 
            AWS. I will be using Ubuntu 18.04, I tried 22.04 and that version does not seem to play well with the new Docker and Kubeadm 
            versions. The containers/pods constantly crashed and after troubleshooting for hours, it seemed to be easier to go with 18.04 
            until the issues are smoothed out.</p>
        
        <p>First and foremost you should ensure that your Ubuntu machine has the newest upgrades/updates & patches.</p>
        
        <p>Command:</p> 
        <div class="code">$ sudo apt-get update && apt-get upgrade</div>

        <p>If you have any issues running this command, you can log in as root with <bold>sudo su -</bold> and then run your update and upgrade commands.</p>
        <br/><br/>
                                                        <center>Installing Docker</center>
        
        <p>To install docker for the first time you can follow the instructions on the website (<a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/" target="_blank">https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/</a>) 
            or just follow the commands here. If you have an older version of docker you may want to remove it first with,</p>
        <p>Command:</p>
        <div class="code">$ sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc</div>
        <p>Please copy and paste these commands to create the repository and GPG keys needed to install Docker.</p>
        <p>Commands:</p>
        
        <div class="code">
            $ sudo apt-get update
            <br/><br/>
            $ sudo apt-get install \
            <br/>
            ca-certificates \
            <br/>
            curl \
            <br/>
            gnupg \
            <br/>
            lsb-release
        </div>
    
        
       <p>To add Docker's GPG key:</p>
        <div class="code">
            $ sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
            <br/><br/>
            $ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
        </div>
        
        <p>To set up the necessary repository for Docker:</p>

        <div class="code">
        $ echo \
        <br/>
        "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
        <br/>
        $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
        </div>
        
        <p>Now for actually installing Docker along with some add-ons (containerd is a necessary CRI for new versions of Kubernetes):</p>
        
        <div class="code">
        $ sudo apt-get update
        <br/><br/>
        $ sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose-plugin
        </div>    
        
        <br/><br/>
        <center>Making a Dockerfile for your Website/App</center>
        
        <p>First, it is recommended to make a docker hub profile to ensure that you have access to a list of the prebuilt docker images 
            such as the nginx image that I am using. This will also give you the opportunity to host your own repository for your custom
            containers that you can make either private or public, just like github.  Keep in mind if the repo is made private you will have
            to add additional keys to your kubernetes yaml to allow it permission to pull the Docker image.</p>
        
        <p>In order to build a docker container you need to start with a "Dockerfile" that will give some instructions on how the container 
            should be built.</p>
        
        <p><bold>This is my current Dockerfile:</bold></p>
        
        <center><img src="../Image/Docker/dockerfile.PNG"></center>
        
        <p>Each line represents a configuration that will be implemented when you run the "docker build" command. I am creating a container 
        that is based off of the ngnix image hosted on the Docker repository. This will give me the base image needed to host the website.
        The line after this ensures that the container has the most recent updates for certain packages and the kernel, etc. 
        Ensure that you COPY your index.html file into the /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html of the container. This will replace the 
        index.html file that is already in the ngnix container. If you don't do this, you risk the container showing the basic splash 
        index.html that pops up on a standard ngnix server. This is a main reason that certain people may have an issue with their website 
        showing THEIR index.html.</p>
        
        
        <p>After this, you want to ensure that you COPY all files in the current directory "." to the same location that you copied your
        index.html file to. This will ensure that all files are in the correct directory for hosting the website within the container. 
        The last command will ensure that port 80 is exposed to the CONTAINER. This does not expose the host machine port. We can customize 
        which port we want to use on the host machine through the "docker build" command on the linux command line. You can also use a 
        docker-compose.yml file that would allow you to fine tune your volumes and port numbers as well. Docker-compose is an orchestrator 
        for containers but since we will be using kubernetes to do our orchestration on AWS, I won't be doing a deep delve into that as of 
        yet.</p>
        
                                        <center>Building your Docker Image from your Dockerfile</center>
        
        <p>After you have made your website/webapp and built your Dockerfile, you can test out your container to ensure that docker is 
        working for you. I am working on a VMWare Workstation 16 player Ubuntu box for the sake of this build. I have VSCode installed 
        on the virtual Ubuntu machine as well. Ensure that you have a copy of your website on the linux box and that you are working from
        the directory that the website and dockerfile are hosted on the CLI.</p>
        
        <p>Once you are in the correct directory within the CLI, you can run the following command:</p>
        <div class="code">$ docker build -t keitzkyle/blog:v1 .</div>
        <p>Ensure that you put the "." at the end to tell docker that you would like the container build to happen in the current directory. 
        Now, the last part 
        of your command is going to be a bit different. The name of my docker profile is keitzkyle and I am naming the docker container 
        blog:v1. The "v1" part is just the tag name. It is essentially a subcategory of the "blog" repo. If you eventually push out a v2, 
        you can keep the two builds seperate. You can push your builds to your docker repo if you intend to pull the image with kubernetes.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>If you intend to do so, I recommend signing into Docker on the CLI with the following command:</p>
        <div class="code">$ docker login</div>
        <p>This command will ask you to sign in with your username and then your password.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>You can then push your image directly to your Docker repo with this command:</p>    
        <div class="code">$ docker push keitzkyle/blog:tagname .</div> 
        <p>Replace the command with your own profile and build name.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>When you run the build command you will start to see the build take place. You will see the commands that you inserted into the 
            Dockerfile take place and the container should be built within seconds. You still wont be able to see your website because although 
            the container is built, it is not yet running. Your build should look something like this:</p>
            <center><image class="dockerbuild": image src="../Image/Docker/docker_build.PNG"></center>
        <br/><br/>
        <center>Running your Docker Image</center>

        <p>Get excited! This is where we get to see all of our hard work in action. Once we run this command, we will be able to see
        our locally hosted website. First, ensure that you are still in the same directory of your docker build file. Now we can run the
        needed command:</p>
        
        <div class="code">$ docker run -p 8080:80 keitzkyle/blog:v1</div>
        <br/>
         
        <p>Ensure that you are replacing the build name and tag with your own. This is going 
        to expose port 8080 of the HOST machine and direct it to port 80 of the container. You do not have to use port 8080, you can 
        realistically use any port that your machine isn't currently using. To check which ports your machine is using, you can use the 
        <bold>netstat</bold> or <bold>netstat -ano</bold> command and you can actively see which ports are already listening or established.</p>
        
        <p>Once you run the command, you should see something similar to this:</p>
        <center><img class="dockerrun": img src="../Image/Docker/docker_run.PNG"></center>
        <p>After you run the command, you should be able to use whatever browser you choose and type in either "localhost:8080" or 
            "127.0.0.1:8080". Your containerized application should appear and act as normal! If you run into any issues make sure that your 
        linux firewall is disabled with <bold>sudo ufw disable</bold>.  You can check on the status of the firewall with
        <bold>sudo ufw status</bold>.</p>
