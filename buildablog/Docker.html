            <h2>Setting up a website in a Docker container</h2>
<p class="paragraph">Want to see how to make a website and put it in a Docker container?</p>
        <br/><br/>
                                        <center>Installing Ubuntu 18.04 and Initializing for Docker</center>

         <p>For the intention of ensuring that my website is working within a docker container I will be using docker on an Ubuntu virtual 
            machine instead of an ec2 instance on AWS. It's easier to spin it up locally first rather than trying to debug any errors on 
            AWS. I will be using Ubuntu 18.04, I tried 22.04 and that version does not seem to play well with the new Docker and Kubeadm 
            versions. The containers/pods constantly crashed and after troubleshooting for hours, it seemed to be easier to go with 18.04 
            until the issues are smoothed out.</p>
        
        <p>First and foremost you should ensure that your Ubuntu machine has the newest upgrades/updates & patches.</p>
        
        <p>Command:</p> 
        <div class="code">$ sudo apt-get update && apt-get upgrade</div>

        <p>If you have any issues running this command, you can log in as root with <bold>sudo su -</bold> and then run your update and upgrade commands.</p>
        <br/><br/>
                                                        <center>Installing Docker</center>
        
        <p>To install docker for the first time you can follow the instructions on the website (<a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/" target="_blank">https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/</a>) 
            or just follow the commands here. If you have an older version of docker you may want to remove it first with,</p>
        <p>command:</p>
        <div class="code">$ sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc</div>
        <p>Please copy and paste these commands to create the repository and GPG keys needed to install Docker.</p>
        <p>Commands:</p>
        
        <div class="code">
            $ sudo apt-get update
            <br/><br/>
            $ sudo apt-get install \
            <br/>
            ca-certificates \
            <br/>
            curl \
            <br/>
            gnupg \
            <br/>
            lsb-release
        </div>
    
        
       <p>To add Docker's GPG key:</p>
        <div class="code">
            $ sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
            <br/><br/>
            $ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
        </div>
        
        <p>To set up the necessary repository for Docker:</p>

        <div class="code">
        echo \
        <br/>
        "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
        <br/>
        $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
        </div>
        
        <p>Now for actually installing Docker along with some add-ons (containerd is a necessary CRI for new versions of Kubernetes):</p>
        
        <div class="code">
        $ sudo apt-get update
        <br/><br/>
        $ sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose-plugin
        </div>    
        
        <br/><br/>
        <center>Making a Dockerfile for your Web App</center>
        
        <p>First, it is recommended to make a docker hub profile to ensure that you have access to a list of the prebuilt docker images 
            such as the nginx image that I am using. This will also give you the opportunity to host your own repository that you can make 
            either private or public, just like github.  Keep in mind if the repo is made private you will have to add some additional
            configuration to your kubernetes yaml to allow it permission to pull the Docker image.</p>
        
        In order to build a docker container you need to start with a "Dockerfile" that will give some instructions on how the container should be built.
        
        This is my current Dockerfile:
        
        FROM nginx
        
        COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
        
        COPY . /usr/share/nginx/html/
        
        EXPOSE 80
        
        Each line represents a configuration that will be implemented when you run the "docker build" command. I am creating a container that is based off of the ngnix image hosted on the Docker repository. This will give me the base image needed to host the website. Ensure that you COPY your index.html file into the /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html of the container. This will replace the index.html file that is already in the ngnix container. If you don't do this, you risk the container showing the basic splash index.html that pops up on a standard ngnix server. This is a main reason that certain people may have an issue with their website showing THEIR index.html.
        
        After this, you want to ensure that you COPY all files in the current directory "." to the same location that you copied your index.html file to. This will ensure that all files are in the correct directory for hosting the website within the container.
        
        The last command will ensure that port 80 is exposed to the CONTAINER. This does not expose the host machine port. We can customize which port we want to use on the host machine through the "docker build" command on the linux command line. You can also use a docker-compose.yml file that would allow you to fine tune your volumes and port numbers as well. Docker-compose is an orchestrator for containers but since we will be using kubernetes to do our orchestration on AWS, I won't be doing a deep delve into that as of yet.
        
        #Docker build
        
        The command: docker build -t keitzkyle/blog:v1 .
        
        Explanation: After you have made your website (mine is not yet complete) and built your Dockerfile within the same directory of your website, you can test out your container to ensure that docker is working for you. I am working with Ubuntu 22.04 and I have VSCode installed on the virtual Ubuntu machine as well. Ensure that you have a copy of your website on the linux box and that you are working from the directory that the website and dockerfile are hosted on the CLI.
        
        Once you are in the correct directory within the CLI, you can run the "docker build -t keitzkyle/blog:v1 ." command. Ensure that you put the "." at the end to tell docker that you would like the container build to happen in the current directory. Now, the last part of your command is going to be a bit different. The name of my docker profile is keitzkyle and I am naming the docker container blog:v1. The "v1" part is just the tag name. It is essentially a subcategory of the "blog" repo. If you eventually push out a v2, you can keep the two builds seperate. You can push your builds to your docker repo for redundancy with the "docker push keitzkyle/blog:tagname". Replace the command with your own profile and build name.
        
        When you run the build command you will start to see the build take place. You will see the commands that you inserted into the Dockerfile take place and the container should be built within seconds. You still wont be able to see your website because although the container is built, it is not yet running.
        
        #Docker run
        
        The command: docker run -p 8080:80 keitzkyle/blog:v1
        
        Explanation: Make sure you are still in the same directory as your website and docker build file. Type in "docker run -p 8080:80 keitzkyle/blog:v1". Ensure that you are replacing the build name and tag with your own. This is going to expose port 8080 of the HOST machine and direct it to port 80 of the container. You do not have to use port 8080, you can realistically use any port that your machine isn't currently using. To check which ports your machine is using, you can use the "netstat" or "netstat -ano" command and you can actively see which ports are already listening or established.
        
        After you run the command, you should be able to use whatever browser you choose and type in either "localhost:8080" or "127.0.0.1:8080". Your containerized application should appear and act as normal!</p>
