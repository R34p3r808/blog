This is an AWS project that will extend into a pipeline.  I am not exactly a coder although I have worked with Python before, this is more or less a simple blog that will follow my journey through this project.

This pipeline will be relatively simple but it will represent my understanding of CI/CD and potentially IaC.  I will most likely be wrapping this website into a docker image that will be administered through kubernetes to show some of my understanding there.

I plan on adding an AWS WAF and potentially testing AWS Guardduty on not only the website but also potential traffic that I get on my home router.

This project is going to eventually focus on mostly cloud security as that is my end goal!
