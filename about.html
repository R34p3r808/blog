        <p class="paragraph"> Hi all!  My name is Kyle and I thank you for stopping by to learn a little bit about me.  Currently, I am happily engaged to my beautiful fianc√©e, Gianna.  We own a German Shepherd, Bentley, who keeps us on our toes.  By toes I mean we never know when the next emergency vet visit will be.  If you have ever owned a Shepherd you may understand the crazy 3 year old child that they will forever inherit. For a Shepherd there is an extremely fine line between relaxing and parkour. </p>

             <p>Here's a few pictures of the goob himself.</p>
             </div>

        <p>There have been a few stressful but positive changes in our lives.  Gianna and I are attempting to get married but we are about to become home owners as well.  To say things are a little hectic would be correct. With this said, I always try to set aside time to learn and keep up with new technologies.  My newest interest has been cloud and security and how they work together.</p>
